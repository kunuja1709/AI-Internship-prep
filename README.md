## Projects

### Ad Copy Generator (Day 2)
Built an ad generator using LLMs that creates marketing copy based on business type and location.

What it does:
- Takes business details as input
- Generates 3 different ad variations
- Scores each ad on quality (checks for call-to-action, urgency, etc.)
- Estimates potential reach based on location

Tech used: Python, Groq API, prompt engineering

Why I built this: GroundTruth works with location-based advertising, so wanted to make something relevant to their business.
